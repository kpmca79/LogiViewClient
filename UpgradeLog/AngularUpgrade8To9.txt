> Static flag migration.
  Removes the `static` flag from dynamic queries.
  As of Angular 9, the "static" flag defaults to false and is no longer required for your view and content queries.
  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-dynamic-flag
  Migration completed.

> Missing @Injectable and incomplete provider definition migration.
  In Angular 9, enforcement of @Injectable decorators for DI is a bit stricter and incomplete provider definitions behave differently.
  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-injectable
  Migration completed.

> ModuleWithProviders migration.
  In Angular 9, the ModuleWithProviders type without a generic has been deprecated.
  This migration adds the generic where it is missing.
  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-module-with-providers
  Migration completed.

> Renderer to Renderer2 migration.
  As of Angular 9, the Renderer class is no longer available.
  Renderer2 should be used instead.
  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-renderer
  Migration completed.

> Undecorated classes with decorated fields migration.
  As of Angular 9, it is no longer supported to have Angular field decorators on a class that does not have an Angular decorator.
  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-undecorated-classes
  Migration completed.

> Undecorated classes with DI migration.
  As of Angular 9, it is no longer supported to use Angular DI on a class that does not have an Angular decorator.
  Read more about this here: https://v9.angular.io/guide/migration-undecorated-classes

    This migration uses the Angular compiler internally and therefore projects that no longer build successfully after the update cannot run the migra
tion. Please ensure there are no AOT compilation errors and rerun the migration. The following project failed: src/tsconfig.app.json

    Error: The Angular Compiler requires TypeScript >=3.6.4 and <3.8.0 but 3.8.3 was found instead.

    Could not migrate all undecorated classes that use dependency
    injection. Some project targets could not be analyzed due to
    TypeScript program failures.

    Migration can be rerun with: "ng update @angular/core --migrate-only migration-v9-undecorated-classes-with-di"

  Migration completed.


Your project has been updated to Angular version 9!
